# README Commons Wall
Visible from both learning commons areas on the third and fourth floors, the Commons Wall is at the center of the libraryâ€™s academic activity. The Roman stairs opposite the Commons Wall can accommodate a large number of simultaneous viewers.

With its more conventional aspect ratio and smaller size, the Commons Wall is a good canvas for those with limited prior experience looking to explore large-scale design.

The Commons Wall is 2884Wx2400H (an aspect ratio of 1.2). There are 9 tiles across and 10 down. It is 10.6 feet wide and 12 feet tall.
