##Text Guidelines
Readability is the ease with which text can be read and understood. Readability is influenced by the content of the text as well as graphical properties of the text and how it is laid out on the screen. Here are a few tips for improving the readability of your text.

* Use no more than two or three typefaces.
* Don’t center or force justify body text.
* Don’t use all uppercase letters or all boldface for body text.
* Make sure there is high contrast between the text and the background (particularly if the text is appearing over a photograph).

The size of your text will also affect its readability. You want your text to be large enough to be read (and in the case of the unique design of the Visualization Wall, text could also be too large to be readable). Average viewing distance differs per wall, which means that each wall has different ideal font sizes. The suggested font sizes in the tables below are given in pixels and are based on the Arial typeface. If you’re unsure whether your graphics program is using pixels or points, make sure to add " px" when entering your desired font size.
