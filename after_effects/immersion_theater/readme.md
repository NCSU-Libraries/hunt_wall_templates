# Immersion Theater After Effects Template

Prominently located to catch the eye of everyone entering the library, the iPearl Immersion Theater is the Hunt Library's premiere digital exhibit space. The right side of the video wall inside the Theater has a gentle curve, which gives content an immersive quality. Visitors can walk up closely to examine details or have a seat to let the experience soak in. Audio capabilities make this the ideal video wall for communicating with voiceovers and soundtracks.

The dimension of the iPearl Immersion Theater is 6824Wx2240H pixels (an aspect ratio of 3.05). 

This template includes both left and right options.
