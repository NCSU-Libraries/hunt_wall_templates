# Visualization Wall Image Guide

**Overview:** The Visualization Wall features the most unique shape of any of the video walls in the Hunt Library. Located outside of the Teaching and Visualization Lab and near our Makerspace, its columnar arrangement presents a canvas that will appeal to the adventurous designer. The best content for this wall takes advantage of the noncontiguous arrangement to produce interesting user experiences. Content can be designed on a single rectangular canvas—the wall will automatically create a “picket fence” effect.
