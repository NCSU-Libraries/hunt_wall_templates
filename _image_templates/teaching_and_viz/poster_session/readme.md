# Teaching and Visualization Lab: Template 3 Notes

In order to add your photos into the template 3, you should use image editing software. This can be done with software as advanced as photoshop, but it can also be done very simply by using the Windows Paint program. After opening the template 3 image in image editing software, simply place and size appropriately the images that you have chosen over the space that is currently occupied by the same images. When finished, save the file as a new file with an appropriate name. Important Notes:
1.	Make sure that the image you are using is at minimum the resolution of the screen that the image will be displayed on. 
    a.	If this is not the case, the image will appear to be grainy and distorted.    
    2.	If there are unused image positions in the template, it is suggested that the white sample image spaces be filled with a black background so that you do not have white spaces in your presentation. 
    a.	This can be done most easily by using a paint bucket tool and simply filling the space with black.
