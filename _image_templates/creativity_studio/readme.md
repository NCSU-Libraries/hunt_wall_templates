# Creativity Studio Image Guides

It features high-definition projectors and movable and writable walls. The Studio can be configured for simulations and virtual environments. The room can be divided into North and South sections, although the divider does not provide enough privacy for unrelated meetings to be held simultaneously in the North and South sections.
