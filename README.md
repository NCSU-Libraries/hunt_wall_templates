# Hunt Video Wall HTML Templates

There are four large video walls built into the public spaces around the Hunt Library. These displays make Hunt a storytelling building, integrating architecture and digital media to facilitate exciting new forms of communication. We curate a program of content for the video walls that is focused on demonstrating NC State's impact.

These HTML templates are part of a Producer's Toolkit to help you design large-scale web content for these displays.

See the NCSU Libraries [video walls webpage](http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/videowalls) for more information.
