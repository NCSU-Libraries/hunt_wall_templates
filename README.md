# Hunt Visualization Space Templates

There are four large video walls built into the public spaces around the Hunt Library, and three high-tech visualization labs and rooms. These displays make Hunt a storytelling building, integrating architecture and digital media to facilitate exciting new forms of scholarly communication.

These templates will help you design large-scale web content for these displays. See the NCSU Libraries [video walls webpage](http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/videowalls) for more information.

You are encouraged to contact us before you begin production work. All content submissions are subject to the editorial review of NCSU Libraries. Email group-videowalls@ncsu.edu with any questions. 

## The Templates

The templates are organized by the platform with which you are producing your work, e.g., Photoshop, web, etc. Once you know your platform, you can find templates for individual walls and spaces within that folder.

The `web/wall_websockets` directory includes an application template that allows you to quickly get started creating an application to allow you to communicate between a remote control Web page and the Art Wall.
