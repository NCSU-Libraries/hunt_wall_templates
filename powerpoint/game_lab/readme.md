# Game Lab PowerPoint Template

The Game Lab supports the scholarly study of digital games as well as a place to take a break and play for fun. Equipped with multiple video gaming systems and a large (20.3x5 foot) Christie® MicroTile® display, which can be used as a single panorama or divided into multiple sections.

The MicroTile screen is 7337W x 1720H.

This template allows a user without web development expertise to present multiple full-screen videos in an interactive display.

It was created using Office 2010, but also works in Office 2013. This template uses ActiveX and Windows Media Player and will only work in Windows.

This template has placeholders for six videos. If you have fewer than six videos, delete the video players you do not want. If you have more than six videos, you may need to edit the VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) along with adding the appropriate number of video players.

Your videos must be saved in the same folder as the PowerPoint file.

There are multiple slides in the PowerPoint to account for errant touching of the MicroTile screen. Once your initial slide is complete, duplicate it to achieve this effect.

When testing the PowerPoint on your computer, you will need to change the file paths accordingly. When using this template in the Game Lab, you will need to use the paths currently in the PowerPoint (after adjusting file names) and your files will need to be saved in the /downloads folder on the Game Lab server.
