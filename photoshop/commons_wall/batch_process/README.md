# Commons Wall
## Photoshop Template Documentation


### Introduction

This documentation will help you create imagery to display on the Hunt Library’s Commons Wall, the video wall visible from the third and fourth floors. Use this documentation in conjunction with the _Hunt Library Video Wall Guide_ at [http://lib.ncsu.edu/videowalls](http://lib.ncsu.edu/videowalls).

The instructions below allow you to quickly prepare a single image or multiple images for the Commons Wall. This is just a starting place: we encourage you to be creative and try new things. However, please remember that all projects for the Commons Wall are subject to the editorial approval of NCSU Libraries. You are encouraged to contact us before you begin work on your project to discuss your vision: group-videowalls@ncsu.edu.

If you decide to create something different than what we have provided in the template, here are a few guidelines to keep in mind:

* For most work, some kind of attribution is preferable.
* You cannot change the aspect ratio or canvas resolution of the .psd file.
* Guides have been placed in the template to indicate the edges of the MicroTiles for your convenience.
* Typography should be readable from the top of the staircase facing the Commons Wall. See the _Text Guidelines_ for more information.


### Prerequisites

It is assumed that you know how to navigate the Layers panel, import images, update text, and drag and resize images in Photoshop.

If you haven’t used Photoshop before, we recommend a one-hour tech consultation about Photoshop basics with one of our digital media assistants: [http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/digital-media-lab/techconsult](http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/digital-media-lab/techconsult).

If you use the “Creating Many Images” instructions, it is also assumed that you know how to enter text into cells and navigate sheets in Excel.

### Creating a Single Image

**1. Prepare Your Image and Documentation**

   * Select an image (for the highest quality final product, a given image should have a minimum height of 2400 pixels).
   * Compile the following information for your image.

| Type of Information | Excel Column Name |
|:------------------- | :-----------------|
|Image file name     |Photo              |
|The title of your image | TitleText |
|The name of the photographer, individual, and/or the organization responsible for the image | Attribution |
|A brief description that will help others appreciate your image; aim for 140 characters (tweet length) | Description |


**2. Open the Photoshop File and Set Up your Workspace**

   * Open “Commons_Wall_Template.psd” and save the Photoshop file with a new filename. We recommend including your UnityID and a project name in the new filename. Do not include spaces. Example: mrnutt_MyGreatProject.psd

   * Guides have been placed to match the locations of the edges of the individual MicroTiles. Make sure the Guides are visible and locked, so that you can see them but they do not get moved accidentally.

   * Make sure the Layers panel is open. The “TEXT” and “IMAGES” folders are where you will insert your own caption text and your image. Make the “IMAGES” folder visible.

   * Within the “IMAGES” folder, there are two folders: “4:3” and “3:2”. You will only need to use one for your project. Select which to use and make visible by looking at the table below..


| Folder Name | Image and Text Placement | Best Uses |
|:--------|:-----------|:---------|
|4:3 | Image takes up the entire screen. Text appears over image. | Images with a 4:3 aspect ratio, including photos taken with a point and shoot camera or an iPhone. |
|3:2 | Image takes up the top 80% of the screen. Text appears over black background on bottom 20%. | Images with a 3:2 aspect ratio, including photos taken with a DSLR camera.|


**3. Import and Position Image**

   * Within the “IMAGE” sub-folder (4:3 or 3:2) that you have chosen to use, select the “IMAGE” layer.

   * Import your image by using File > Place or by dragging the image onto the Document window.

   * Drag and resize the image to your liking. No red should be visible behind the image when you are done. Note: Make sure to constrain proportions when you resize the image. This can be done by holding down the Shift key when dragging the handles of the bounding box.


**4. Update Text**

   * Update the text in the “TEXT” folder as outlined in the table in Step 1.

   * Be aware of how your text falls on the Guides. You don’t want any letter stems to disappear between MicroTiles. There are a few ways to adjust your text if this happens:

     * Move the text one or two pixels left or right. All three text layers are linked; if you move one of the layers, the others will also move to ensure the three lines continue to be left-aligned.

     * Adjust the tracking for that block of text in small increments.

**5. Save and Export Image**

   * Save your Photoshop file.
   * Export your composition using Save As... and the following specifications:
     * Format: JPEG
     * Embed Color Profile
     * Matte: None
     * Quality: 12 (Maximum)
     * Format Options: Baseline (“Standard”)  

**6. Send file to NCSU Libraries**

Once you have a finished file, you are ready to submit it to the NCSU Libraries for review. Go to the content agreement and submission form at [http://go.ncsu.edu/ContentAgreement](http://go.ncsu.edu/ContentAgreement).

Submissions are subject to the editorial review of the NCSU Libraries. An NCSU Libraries staff member will be in contact with you about your submission.




### Creating Many Images

**1. Prepare Images and Documentation**

* Select a group of images (for the highest quality final product, a given image should have a minimum height of 2400 pixels).
* Compile the following information for each image.


|Type of Information | Excel Column Name |
|:--|:---|
|Image file name | Photo |
|The title of your image | TitleText |
| The name of the photographer, individual, and/or the organization responsible for the image | Attribution |
|A brief description that will help others appreciate your image; aim for 140 characters (tweet length) | Description |


**2. Set Up Your Folders**

* Create one folder for the images that you collected in Step 1 (“Folder 1”) and another folder for your final images (“Folder 2”).
* Put all images and information gathered in Step 1 into “Folder 1”.
* Open “Commons_Wall_Template.xlsx” and save with a descriptive name that you’ll use for all files in this process, including the final images. Do not use spaces. We recommend including your UnityID and a project name in the new filename. Do not include spaces. Example: mrnutt_MyGreatProject. Save this file in “Folder 1”.
* Open “Commons_Wall_Template.psd” and save with the same descriptive name you used above. Save this file in “Folder 1”.

**3. Compile Image and Attribution Information in Excel [Excel]**

* Open the Excel file you saved in “Folder 1”.
* Use the information you collected in Step 1 to fill out the “test_info” sheet. DO NOT add columns or change column names. You may add rows.
* Note about quotation marks: The batch process will not work if you start a field such as TitleText with a quotation mark. Likewise, make sure you are not using smart (curly) quotes anywhere in your information.
* This sheet will help you determine if any of your text needs to be edited before you create your images.
  * Every cell needs to have text in it. Create a title or short description if not available for a photo.
  * If information for more than 2 images was added, highlight cells E3 - G3 and drag the square in the bottom right down the appropriate number of rows
  * If any cells are yellow, this means that the text MIGHT NOT FIT in the Photoshop template. Consider shortening it.
  * If any cells are red, this means that the text WILL NOT FIT in the Photoshop template. Shorten the too long text.
  * Select File > Save.

**4. Save a Tab Delimited Text File [Excel]**

* Click on the “final_info” sheet to make it active.
* If more than 2 rows of information were added in Step 4, highlight cells A3 - D3 and drag the square down the appropriate number of rows. The rows still automatically populate with the information you entered in Step 3.
* Save a tab delimited text file in “Folder 1”.
  * Select File > Save As.
  * Make sure the file is being saved in “Folder 1”.
  * Change the Format to Tab Delimited Text (.txt). Click “Save.”
  * You may get a warning that the workbook cannot be saved because it contains multiple sheets. Click “Save Active Sheet.”
  * You may get a warning that the workbook contains features that will not work in the selected file format. Click “Continue.”

**5. Import Information to Photoshop [Photoshop]**

* Open the Photoshop file that you saved in “Folder 1”.
* Guides have been placed to match the locations of the edges of the individual MicroTiles. Make sure the Guides are visible and locked, so that you can see them but they do not get moved accidentally.
* Make sure the Layers panel is open. Make the “BULK IMAGES” folder visible. Within the “BULK IMAGES” folder, there are two layers: “4:3” and “3:2”. You will only need to use one for your project. Select which to use and make visible by looking at the table below.

|Layer Name | Image and Text Placement | Best Uses |
|:--------|:-----------|:---------|
|4:3 | Image takes up the entire screen. Text appears over image. | Images with a 4:3 aspect ratio, including photos taken with a point and shoot camera or an iPhone. |
|3:2 | Image takes up the top 80% of the screen. Text appears over black background on bottom 20%. | Images with a 3:2 aspect ratio, including photos taken with a DSLR camera.|

* Select Image > Variables > Data Sets
* Click “Import…”
* Select the file you saved in Step 4.
* Make sure “Use First Column For Data Set Names” and “Replace Existing Data Sets” are checked.
* Click “OK.”
* Click “OK.”


**6. Export Photoshop Files [Photoshop]**

* Select File > Export > Data Sets as Files…
* Choose “Folder 2”.
* Make sure “All Data Sets” is selected in the Data Set drop-down.
* Click “OK”. This could take some time, depending on how many files you’re creating.
* Note: This step generates individual Photoshop files for each of your images; this will allow you to go back and tweak individual images if needed.

**7. Export Images [Photoshop]**

* Select File > Scripts > Image Processor…
* In section 1 of the Image Processor window, select the radio button next to “Select Folder…” and choose your “Folder 2”.
* In section 2, select the “Save in Same Location” radio button.
* In section 3, check “Save as JPEG” and set the Quality to 12.
* Click “Run”.
