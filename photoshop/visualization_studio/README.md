# Visualization Studio
This is a basic Photoshop template to utilize the entire desktop area of the Visualization Studio at D. H. Hill Library.

The Visualization Studio enables 360 degree projection through 12 video projectors (3 per wall). Each projector operates at a resolution of 1024w x 768h pixels. Thus, each wall measures 3072 x 768 pixels and a window spanning all four walls would measure 12288w x 768h pixels.

# Using This Template
This template provides guidelines that approximate the area of each 1024 x 768 projector. These lines are not visible upon export and can be toggled on and off by checking View > Show > Guides.

The template was created in Photoshop CC 2015.5.1 with maximum compatibility turned on.

# Displaying Your Content

The room has a piece of software that allows you to display images 360 degrees around. There is a folder on the desktop labelled “collage”. Open the folder and click the batch file to active the software. The screen will turn black and a file window will pop up prompting you to select image. Use the ‘control’ + right click on the mouse to select multiple images to open. When all images are selected, hit “open”. Once the images are all open, hit “3” to make images align with a project or ‘f ’ to fit each image vertically. If you have a panoramic image, hit “5” to expand it 360 around the room. To quit, hit, ‘q’. If hitting the ‘f’ or ‘q’ doesn’t work, double check that the caps lock is not on. For more hot keys, see the collage manual inside the studio.

You can also choose to display your image as the desktop image and temporarily hide the icons on the desktop. You can advance through a folder of images by right-clicking on the desktop and selecting 'Next desktop background.'

You may notice gaps or crossover between some of the projectors in the Studio. They have been aligned as accurately as possible given the available technology and existing construction limitations. If this is a concern for your content, you may want to consider laying out your content so that it does not go right up to the guidelines in this template. This will decrease the visible effect of any alignment issues.
