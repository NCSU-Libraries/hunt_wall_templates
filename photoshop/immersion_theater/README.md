# iPearl Immersion Theater

Prominently located to catch the eye of everyone entering the library, the iPearl Immersion Theater
is the Hunt Library's premiere digital exhibit space. The right side of the video wall inside the Theater has a gentle curve, which gives content an immersive quality. Visitors can walk up closely to examine details or have a seat to let the experience soak in. Audio capabilities make this the ideal video wall for communicating with voiceovers and soundtracks.
