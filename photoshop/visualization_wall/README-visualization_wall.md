# Visualization Wall HTML Template

The Visualization Wall features the most unique shape of any of the video walls in the Hunt Library. Located outside of the Teaching and Visualization Lab and near our Makerspace, its columnar arrangement presents a canvas that will appeal to the adventurous designer. The best content for this wall takes advantage of the noncontiguous arrangement to produce interesting user experiences. Content can be designed on a single rectangular canvas—the wall will automatically create a “picket fence” effect.

It is 3840px wide by 1518px high, an aspect ratio of 2.53. The wall occupies an area 25.3 feet wide and 10 feet tall. Each of the seven columns is 10 tiles high. The second and fourth columns from the left are two tiles wide instead of one.
