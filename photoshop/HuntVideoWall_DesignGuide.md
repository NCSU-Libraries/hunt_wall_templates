### MicroTiles Video Wall | Design Guide

#### Introduction
This documentation will help you create imagery to display in the Hunt Library’s Micro-Tiles video walls. This is just a starting place: we encourage you to be creative and try new things. However, please remember that all projects submitted for the video walls are subject to the editorial approval of NCSU Libraries. You are encouraged to contact us at group-videowalls@ncsu.edu before you begin working on your project, so that we can discuss your vision.

This guide is designed to be used in conjunction with the Hunt Library Video Walls Guide, which can be found at http://lib.ncsu.edu/videowalls.

These instructions are written for Adobe Photoshop CS6, but should be adequate to walk you through the process of other versions of Photoshop. This walk-through assumes basic familiarity with Photoshop. If you haven’t used Photoshop before, we recommend that you start with the video tutorials from Lynda.com. You can access these tutorials at either Hunt or Hill libraries: http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/cdm/lynda

#### Download and Open the Template
1. We offer several templates for the video walls. Go to http://lib.ncsu.edu/videowalls for more information.
2. The package includes two folders with a few templates each, an examples folder, and this user guide. The templates in the folder 1. UNIVERS use the Univers typeface, while those in 2. ARIAL use the Arial typeface. In keeping with the NCSU brand guidelines, you are strongly encouraged to use the Univers typeface.
3. In case you do not have the Univers font installed on your system, please contact the NC State brand administrators at ncstatebrand@ncsu.edu to obtain a license free of charge.
4. The naming system of the Photoshop template files is shown below:

#### Import Images
5. Notice the Layers panel on the right on opening the document. The layers are named and grouped together to help you better organize your content.
6. Within the folder labeled INSERT IMAGE(S) you will find the layers IMAGE_PLACEMENT_01 and IMAGE_PLACEMENT_02 which will help you organize and layout your image(s) in the composition. These layers only serve as a starting point, and the visibility for these layers can be turned off if not required. [See Fig.01]
7. To import your images into your project, you may simply drag-and-drop the image into Photoshop. Alternatively, from the menu bar, click FILE > PLACE and select the image you want.
8. Once you have selected an image and placed it in your document, adjust the size by holding down SHIFT and dragging the handle bars at the corners of the image. Use the IMAGE_PLACEMENT layers as a guide for image placement and sizing. Do not stretch the image you are importing unequally in the horizontal and vertical directions.
9. Once you have decided the placement and scale, hit Enter. To re-adjust your image size, select the image layer and use the keyboard shortcut CMD+T on a Mac or CTRL+T on a Windows machine. This will enable you to use the corner handle bars to resize the image.

#### Organize and Crop
10. While placing images in the template be aware of your overall composition, which depends, among other things, on the number of images you wish to add to the template. 
11. In order to fit the video wall canvas, you may have to crop some images to align your content suitably.
12. First, you must rasterize the image you are cropping. Select the layer containing your image from the layers panel. On the Menu bar, click LAYER > RASTERIZE > LAYER (if available).
13. Use the MARQUEE TOOL to highlight the section of the image you wish to delete. Press the DELETE key to delete the selection. Remember to use the guides to accurately select the portion of the image for cropping. [See Fig.02]

#### Annotate
14. Replace the template text with your own title and attribution (e.g. the name of your organization). Within the layers folder labeled INSERT YOUR TEXT you will find the placeholders for your title and attribution text descriptors.
15. Use the TEXT TOOL (keyboard shortcut: T ) to edit the text. Keep in mind that the average eye-level in the USA is approximately 5’8” for males and 5’3” for females.
16. After editing, you must click on the check mark on the top toolbar to confirm the edit.
17. Make sure to disable the visibility of the following layers before you export your final composition: [See Fig.03]
  * MICROTILE_GRID layer group
  * AVOID TEXT HERE layer group
  * IMAGE_PLACEMENT_01 and IMAGE_PLACEMENT_02 layers

#### Export your project
18. From the menu bar, click FILE > SAVE AS
19. Choose the directory to save in, and give the file a suitable name. Choose JPEG as the file format, and make sure ICC PROFILE is checked. [See Fig.04]
20. Choose NONE for matte. Make sure the image quality is set to 12 (MAXIMUM). Select BASELINE (STANDARD) for the format options. [See Fig.05]

#### Upload file to NCSU Libraries
21. Once you have a finished file, you are ready to submit it to the NCSU Libraries. Go to the content agreement and submission form at http://go.ncsu.edu/ContentAgreement. Submissions are subject to the editorial review of the NCSU Libraries. An NCSU Libraries staff member will be in contact with you about your submission.
